### Passing the file from the frontend to the backend

Captured the body in the request

Used .read() to read the file as bytes, basically raw bytes

BytesIO() will then create an in-memory stream, a file-like object, from the raw bytes

docx.Document() either accepts a path to a docx file or a file-like object as stated above
